# DelugeProxy
**DelugeProxy** is a *defence reverse proxy* server with the aim of deceiving these security scanners into thinking that the attack was successful for each tentative.

**DelugeProxy** is configured to detect some attacks that aim to exploit some of the most common web vulnerabilities.

The web vulnerabilities covered by **DelugeProxy** are:
- **SQL Injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting**
- **Path Traversal**
- **Command Injection**
- **Local File Inclusion**

Once configured on a web application, for each incoming request, **DelugeProxy** will perform a security check on each parameter of the request before redirecting it to the web application. These checks are performed using **RegEx** (specified in  *`traps/payloads.json`*) specially developed to catch many of the web attacks listed above. Using these RegEx, **DelugeProxy** can distinguish requests that could be malicious from safe ones.

This behavior is very similar to the general approach of WAFs (Web Application Firewalls). The difference is that, instead of blocking "malicious" requests, **DelugeProxy** responds with pages containing trap data, that aim to fool automated security analysis tools.

Well-formed requests and those deemed "*malicious*" are logged in the *`logs/access.log`* and *`logs/malicious.log`* files, respectively.

# Configuration
**DelugeProxy** configuration is done server-side.

For the configuration, it is necessary to expose it as a service on the same port as the web application, that you want to protect, to replace it for external users. Then change that of the web application to another port (*specifying to listen only locally*).

## An example of Apache2 configuration in an operating system based on the Linux kernel

#### **`/etc/apache2/site-enables/000-default.conf`**

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName webapp.name
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/flaskapp
	WSGIDaemonProcess flaskapp threads=5
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/flaskapp/flaskapp.wsgi
        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
        <Directory flaskapp>
             WSGIProcessGroup flaskapp
             WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
             Order deny,allow
             Allow from all 
        </Directory>
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:9000>
	ServerName webapplocal.name
	DocumentRoot /var/www/webapp
	<Directory /var/www/webapp>
		Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride Limit Options FileInfo
		DirectoryIndex index.php
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

#### **`/etc/apache2/ports.conf`**
```
# If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also
# have to change the VirtualHost statement in
# /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

Listen 80
Listen 127.0.0.1:9000

<IfModule ssl_module>
        Listen 443
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
        Listen 443
</IfModule>
```

In **`flaskapp.py`**, is necessary to set the value of the following variables:

- *`site_port`* : with the value of the new site port
- *`proxyaddress`* : with ip address of the server where it is hosted
- *`proxydomain`* : with the name specified by *`ServerName`*
- *`function_mode`* :
    - "*`On`*" if **DelugeProxy** should respond to fake data requests it deems malicious.
    - "*`Off`*" if **DelugeProxy** should only log requests it deems malicious to separate files.
- *`whitelist`* : with the path of the web pages where **DelugeProxy** must not block requests by responding with fake data
